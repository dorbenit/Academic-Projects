# ðŸŽ“ Academic Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of academic projects I completed as part of my B.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering at Ben-Gurion University.

Each folder in this repo represents a different course project or hands-on exercise, written in various languages and tools depending on the topic.

##  Contents

###  `datascience-r`
Projects and exercises in R, focused on exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, and statistical modeling.  
>  *This section is still a work in progress and will be updated as I continue the course.*

###  `numerical-analysis`
Python implementations of numerical algorithms including interpolation, root-finding methods, numerical integration, and curve fitting.

###  `oop-aquarium`
An object-oriented simulation in Python, showcasing class design, inheritance, and polymorphism through a dynamic aquarium system.

###  `generic-adt-c`
A generic Abstract Data Type implementation in C, emphasizing modular design, memory management, and pointer handling.


Each subdirectory includes its own README with more detailed explanations.
